[appbase-js](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) is a universal JavaScript client library for working with the appbase.io database, for Node.JS and Javascript (browser UMD build is in the [dist/](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js/tree/master/dist) directory); compatible with [elasticsearch.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html).

An up-to-date documentation for Node.JS API is available at http://docs.appbase.io/javascript/quickstart.

## 1. appbase-js: Intro

[appbase-js](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) is a universal JavaScript client library for working with the appbase.io database.

## 2. Features

It can:

- Index new documents or update / delete existing ones.
- Work universally with Node.JS, Browser, and React Native.

It can't:

- Configure mappings, change analyzers, or capture snapshots. All these are provided by [elasticsearch.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) - the official Elasticsearch JS client library.

[Appbase.io - the database service](https://appbase.io) is opinionated about cluster setup and hence doesn't support the Elasticsearch devops APIs. See [rest.appbase.io](https://rest.appbase.io) for a full reference on the supported APIs.

## 3. Live Examples

## 4. Installation

We will fetch and install the **appbase-js** lib using npm. `4.0.0-beta` is the most current version.

```js
npm install appbase-js
```

Adding it in the browser should be a one line script addition.

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://unpkg.com/appbase-js/dist/appbase-js.umd.min.js"
></script>
```

Alternatively, a UMD build of the library can be used directly from [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appbase-js/dist/).

To write data to [appbase.io](https://appbase.io), we need to first create a reference object. We do this by passing the appbase.io API URL, app name, and credentials into the `Appbase` constructor:

```js
var appbaseRef = Appbase({
  url: "https://appbase-demo-ansible-abxiydt-arc.searchbase.io",
  app: "good-books-demo",
  credentials: "c84fb24cbe08:db2a25b5-1267-404f-b8e6-cf0754953c68",
});
```

**OR**

```js
var appbaseRef = Appbase({
  url: "https://c84fb24cbe08:db2a25b5-1267-404f-b8e6-cf0754953c68@appbase-demo-ansible-abxiydt-arc.searchbase.io",
  app: "good-books-demo",
});
```

Credentials can also be directly passed as a part of the API URL.
